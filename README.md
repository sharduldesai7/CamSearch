# SearchCam
Capture an image using camera and search its description online

## How it works
Image is captured and stored. Then Firebase Vision ML Kit reads the image and labels it using its algorithm.

## Limitations
1. Cannot recognize all images with above 0.9 accuracy
2. App may have issue with activity re-transition.
